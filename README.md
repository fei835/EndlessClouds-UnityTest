Structure wise, I would probably split the content of the EnemyManager, have a dedicated pool management System,
and use a Mission structure to set enemy waves and/or level designs on a bigger project.
However given the small scale of the assignement, separating would actually make it more tedious to read.
I gave the EnemyManager all the functions and would separate on project growth and necessity.
For this specific case, clarity and ease of read was prioritized over long term bigger scale structure.
